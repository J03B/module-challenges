                        My name is Joe Black. Having been at Epic since mid 2021, I have loved making a difference in the world of healthcare. I've had opportunities to work with technical teams, clinical operations, and even hospital executives to aid in optimizing their health care software solutions. I've also enjoyed developing code to find areas to be improved, clean up server objects, and continue to develop solutions to report on critical patient data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to my Epic journey, I interned with Valero Energy where I was given the opportunity to work with the Process Engineering Team. I was given projects to increase unit reliability, optimizing process speed. I was also assigned tasks to monitor daily trends, perform safety audits, model important equipment, and reduce the generation of hazardous materials. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my BYU experience where I studied Chemical Engineering, I worked as a Research Assistant for the DIPPR 801 Project. I love to stay actively involved; I was the Vice President for the AIChE - BYU Local Chapter, I played bass guitar for a local folk band, and even now continue to participate in regular service projects in the community. I live an active lifestyle by working out frequently, reading various types of books, especially self-improvement books. I'm focused as well as both emotionally and culturally intelligent. I communicate well and have a need to always achieve more. To describe myself in one word, I would use "proactive".
