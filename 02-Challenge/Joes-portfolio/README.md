# Challenge 2 - Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Final Deployed Webpage

[Joe Black's Coding Portfolio](https://j03b.github.io/module-challenges/02-Challenge/Joes-portfolio/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a personal portfolio of work that I have done and continue to do.

### Site Specifications

This site should have the following sections: Header and navigation bar, subheader, About Me section, a Work Portfolio section, Contact Me section, and a Resume section. It must be compatible with various screen sizes.

### Mock Up

### Task Completed

This week's task was to create a portfolio from scratch. In this case, I am my own customer, so perfection is my own personal standard.
A portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. As an effective portfolio, it highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Since students who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp, it is imperitive that I have my own.
This Challenge should set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

#### Exceeding Expectations

To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, there were small issues in the code that could slide elsewhere, but I fixed them to ensure everything functions as perfectly as possible. I clean up, organize, and consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Instructions

### Testing the deployed site

To test the changes made for this project, you can ensure that the deployed site is accessible with tools such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Also ensure that all links work as expected, including the Resume link. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
