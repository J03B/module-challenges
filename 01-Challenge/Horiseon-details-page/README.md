# Challenge 1 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Final Deployed Webpage

[Horiseon Search, Manage, and Market](https://j03b.github.io/module-challenges/01-Challenge/Horiseon-details-page/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to make the Horiseon webiste more accessible and to clean up the HTML and CSS files.

### Site Specifications

This site should have at least a 90% resemblence of the mock up image below. It can be compared side-by-side with the deployed site in the link above. 

### Mock Up

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](../Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

### Task Completed

This week's task was to modify existing code, otherwise known as refactoring. This process is to improve it without changing what it does so it meets a certain set of standards or implements a new technology. In this case, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
One of the most important considerations is to ensures that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibile sites rank higher in search engines like Google and helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website. Accessibility can include complex requirements, but the tech lead has given me a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

#### Exceeding Expectations

To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, there were small bugs in the codebase that I fixed to ensure  all links function correctly. I clean up, organize, and consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Instructions

### Testing the deployed site

To test the changes made for this project, you can ensure that the deployed site is accessible with tools such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
