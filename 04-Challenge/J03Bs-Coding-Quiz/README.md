# Challenge 4 - Advanced Javascript: Web APIs - Coding Quiz

## Final Deployed Webpage

[Joe Black's Coding Quiz](https://j03b.github.io/module-challenges/04-Challenge/J03Bs-Coding-Quiz/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a dynamic coding quiz. The app will run in the browser featuring HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

### Site Specifications

This site should have the following sections: Header and navigation bar, a quiz question sections, and a high scores section. It must be compatible with various screen sizes.

### Mock Up

### Task Completed

This week's task was to create a coding quiz from scratch. In this case, I am my own customer, so perfection is my own personal standard.
A coding quiz helps prepare myself for the appropraite skills and talents that employers look for to fill a part-time or full-time position. As an effective quiz, it should have tough questions and store the high score data. It should be able to clear the high scores as well for a fresh slate.
This Challenge should set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, namely Javascript Web APIs. The criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

#### Exceeding Expectations

To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve codebase for long-term sustainability. I ensure everything functions as perfectly as possible. I clean up, organize, and consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and include comments before each element or section of the page.

## Instructions

### Testing the deployed site

To test this project, you can ensure that the deployed site works as expected, including when storing and clearing high scores. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

### Acceptance Criteria
